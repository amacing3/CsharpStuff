Loops are good ways to run blocks of code repetedly. It makes it so you don't need to retype the same code if you want to do the same thing multiple times. There are several different kinds of loops such as: for, while, do while, and foreach. These are each used for different things. The for loop is good for running through numbers. For example if you want to decrease or increase the amount of something every time the loop runs. For loops must have at least 2 perameters in parentheses. A while loop can do similar things. Do while loops are a little different to set up. You write the keyword 'do' then put curly braces and the code you want to run. After that you will put the keyword 'while' and set the conditions. A do while loop will always run at least once. Foreach loops are used for arrays. It will go through the array and complete whatever task it is given and stop when it runs out of items.
