Arrays are a handy way to store information that can be used all at once. You initialize arrays by declaring what they are going to be, e.g. int or string, followed by square brackets. You then put an equals sign and can do two things. Either you simply declare how many items are in your array or nameing the items you want in your array. Arrays are handy for loops because you can have the loop run for however many items are in the array.
