So classes are a sort of container for groups of code. You use them to separate and organize your code. You want to use classes to create small bits of code rather than having one huge chunk that constitutes the whole program. This way you can keep track of all the different things you are using so it's easier to find and change when you need to. You can use a class within a class. Scope is what parts of the code can be seen with other parts. This is normally indicated with curly brackets. In C# you also use access modifiers to determine the scope of something. You will type 'public' or 'private' to indicate what parts can be seen by others. Public can be seen by everything so any piece of code can use it. Private can only be seen within that class so it can't be tampered with by other classes.
