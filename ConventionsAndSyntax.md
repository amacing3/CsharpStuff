C# is a strict language so it's important to understand the syntax and conventions that are used. In C# and Javascript you always end lines with semicolons, capture blocks of code with curley braces, and indent where needed. The curley braces are specifically used for things like functions, if statement, and, in the case of C#, classes. Indentation is used primarity to keep your code organized and looking nice. It helps you read where things begin and end if it's indented properly. Where C# and Javascript become very different is the syntax. In Javascript you can type the keyword 'var' and assign it any value, whether it be an int or a string it doesn't matter. In C# however, you have to put the specific keyword for what you want the variable to do. For example you need 'int', 'string', 'float', etc. for each specific thing you want. You have to start a function the same way or use the term 'void' if you don't want the function to return anything. In Javascript you just type the keyword 'function', name it, and put your perameters in.
