When wokring with code you have to use variables of different data types. There are primarily two different data types which are value and reference. Value data types are things like int, float, bool, etc. Classes are a reference type. Value data types actually hold information about something while reference is a sort of address to that information. So you can use value data types to set up lines of code that will perform some action then useing just one line of code you can reference that value so you don't need to be retyping the same code over and over. Variables are a sort of container for information. You type something like int or bool depending on what you want that variable to do. Functions are a sort of machine that actually uses those variables to perform an action. You can use functions to change different things with your variable. Some functions are void and don't return any values but others do. So you use variables to set up an 'object' and use functions to do a more complex action with those variables such as generating a random number to determine what level in a game you might appear in or get a random number that you attack a monster with.
