If statements are an easy way to test if something is true or false. They are fairly simple to use. You just type if and set some perameters in perentheses. These perameters are the things that test if true or false. So you can have it do something like test if a value is greater or less than a certain number. Then in curley braces you put something that the program will do if the perameter you set is true. You can also add an 'else' or 'else if' after an if statement to test for other things. So let's say you have an if statement followed by both an else if and else. This is basically saying 'if something do this, but if something else do this, but if not either than do this'. It's a nice way to give yourself some options if you are creating a game for example.
